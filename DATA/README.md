## Retirement Planning Calculations
### Required Inputs
<ul>
  <li>Current Age</li>
  <li>Retirement Age (Generally 60)</li>
  <li>Life Expectancy (in Years)</li>
  <li>Monthly Income</li>
  <li>Inflation Rate (Normally 3% - 15% in India) Generally 6% </li>
  <li>Expected Return on Investment (Pre-retirement)</li>
  <li>Expected Return on Investment (Post-retirement)</li>
  <li>Having any Existing Savings or Investment for Retirement ? </li>
</ul>

### Output Expected
<ul>
  <li>Annual Income required immediately after retirement.</li>
  <li>Additional Retirement Fund which needs to be accumulated.</li>
  <li>Monthly Savings required to accumulate the fund.</li>
</ul>


## Formula Approach for the above things
<ul>
    <li>
      <strong>FV = PV * (1+r)^n</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>FV = Future Value</li>
        <li>PV = Present Value</li>
        <li>r = expected inflation @6%</li>
        <li>n = time to retirement (60 years - 35 years) = 25 years</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Example</strong>
    <br />
    <strong>PV = 3500, r = 6%, n = 25</strong>
    <br />
    <strong>FV = 3500 * (1 + 0.06) ^ 25 = Rs. 1,50,215.50</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The annual income required immediately after retirement is = Rs. 18,02,586</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Converting it to yearly = 150215.50 * 12 = Rs. 18,02,586</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Calculation of Retirement Corpus to generate an annual income of Rs. 18,02,586 at the start of the retirement period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Retirement Period = 20 years (Life Expectancy - Age of Retirement)</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Life Expectancy = 80 years</li>
          <li>Age of Retirement = 60 years</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Retirement Period in months = 20 years * 12 = 240 months</li>
      <li>Rate of return on Corpus = 8%</li>
      <li>Inflation Rate = 6%</li>
      <li>Inflation Adjusted Rate of Return = (1 + 8%)/(1 + 6%) - 1 => 1.89%/12 => 0.001575 </li>
      <li>Payment for annual = Inflation Adjusted Rate of Return/12 => Rs. 18,02,586/12 => Rs. 1,50,215</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
